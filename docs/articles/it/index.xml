According to 40% of voters, Catherine Connolly enjoyed the best performance, compared to 11% for Humphreys and 9% who were unsure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strikingly, every intended Connolly voter that watched the just over hour-long showdown said that she won the debate. Connolly supporters were also the most engaged overall – reporting the highest rates of viewership among all other voting groups. This kind of unwavering and disciplined engagement points to a higher propensity among this group to have turned out on polling day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
