The poll was conducted between 18 and 21 February, and this specific question received responses from 835 students, indicating a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4%\nCurrently, all students are automatically enrolled in the union, with TCDSU receiving nearly €400,000 in funding from the capitation grant in the 2022/23 academic year, according to the Financial Statements provided by the union. This money is a portion of the Student Levies \u0026 Charges fee, which among other expenses, is shared between the four capitated bodies on campus - The Central Societies Committee, Trinity Sport Union, TCDSU, and Trinity publications. In response to being asked if students should have the choice to join TCDSU, 16.8% strongly agreed with the statement, while 19.9% indicated that they agreed. 27.7% of students disagreed with the sentiment that membership should be optional, with 12.9% strongly disagreeing. 22.8% of students neither agreed or disagreed with the statement.\nThe demographics that most supported a choice to join TCDSU were students in Multi faculty courses, Senior Freshman, and male students with 48.8%, 44.7%, and 43.9% in some sort of agreement with the proposition respectively. In contrast, only 21.4% of non binary students, 27.9% of Senior Sophister students, and 32% of Female students are either in full or partial agreement with the question.\nTo introduce an optional membership structure, Section 1.2 of the TCDSU constitution must be amended. A change to this part of the constitution would require either two-thirds of a TCDSU council meeting to vote in favour of a referendum, or a petition signed by 500 students. The referendum would then need to garner support from over 50% of students to be passed. While a combined 37% of respondents indicated a preference for an opt-in system would not be enough to enact such a measure, two findings in the data could make the unions mandate less stable. First, nearly a quarter of respondents were undecided on the hypothetical proposal; in a real referendum, a shift in the sentiment of these voters could swing the outcome. Second, there is widespread dissatisfaction: 42.5% feel unsupported by College and 41.2% feel unrepresented by TCDSU. 80% of those who feel unrepresented by the union would back an optional membership system.\n","wordCount":"412","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://benh7702.github.io/articles/SU_cover.png","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benh7702.github.io/articles/tn/su/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ben Heskin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benh7702.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class="header sticky-header"><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benh7702.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Ben Heskin (Alt + H)">Ben Heskin</a>
